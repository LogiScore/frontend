## 1. Introduction

LogiScore is a shipper-only platform designed to increase transparency in freight forwarding. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal data in compliance with applicable laws, including Singapore‚Äôs **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)** and, where applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

We may collect the following categories of information:

* **Account Information:** Business name, contact person, business email (corporate domains only), phone number.
* **Verification Information:** Proof of shipment (e.g., AWB, Bill of Lading). Sensitive shipment details are anonymized and not shared with forwarders.
* **Usage Data:** Login times, IP address, device type, and browsing behavior on the platform.
* **Ratings Data:** Your submitted ratings across service categories.
* **Payment Data:** Subscription billing is processed securely by **Stripe**. We do not collect or store credit card numbers, CVV codes, or full payment details. We only retain limited billing metadata such as subscription type, invoice references, and payment status.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Data

* To verify that you are a genuine shipper.
* To maintain account integrity (e.g., blocking free/personal email domains).
* To display aggregated ratings of freight forwarders.
* To detect and prevent fraudulent activity.
* To process subscriptions and billing through Stripe.
* To communicate with you regarding platform updates, policy changes, and service issues.

---

## 4. Information Sharing / Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your data. Information may be shared:

* With **service providers** (hosting, payment via Stripe, email delivery) under strict data protection agreements.
* In response to **legal requests** (court orders, regulatory authorities).
* As part of **aggregated, anonymized reporting** (e.g., score averages), which cannot identify individual shippers.

Reviewer Anonymity
LogiScore allows shippers to submit reviews anonymously. Forwarders and other third parties will not see the reviewer‚Äôs identity. LogiScore verifies that all reviews come from genuine shippers, but the identity of individual reviewers remains strictly confidential.

Disclosure of Identities
LogiScore will never voluntarily disclose a reviewer‚Äôs identity to a forwarder or third party. Reviewer information may only be disclosed if LogiScore is legally required to do so under a valid court order or applicable law from a court of competent jurisdiction.

Limitation of Liability
By submitting a review, you acknowledge that while LogiScore takes all reasonable steps to preserve anonymity, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed if compelled by law.

## 5. Data Retention

* Account data is retained while your subscription is active and up to 24 months after termination.
* Verification documents are stored securely for audit purposes and deleted after **12 months**.
* **Payment records** (e.g., invoices and receipts) are retained for accounting and compliance purposes as required by law.
* LogiScore does not store sensitive payment data (credit card numbers, CVV codes); these are handled exclusively by **Stripe** in accordance with their [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).
* Anonymized ratings remain in the system to ensure platform integrity.

---

## 6. Security

* Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* Access to verification documents is restricted to authorized staff only.
* Regular security audits are conducted.
