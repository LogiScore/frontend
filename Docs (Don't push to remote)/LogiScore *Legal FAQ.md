# ⚖️ LogiScore Legal FAQ

## 5. What happens if a review is false or abusive?

* Reviews are **structured 1–5 ratings only** (no free-text).

* Reviews are treated as **opinions**, not factual claims.
* Users are legally responsible for their own submissions.
* Where applicable (e.g., U.S. operations), LogiScore relies on **safe harbor protections** such as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

---

## 8. What happens if a forwarder sues LogiScore?

* Ratings are opinion-based and structured (not text narratives), which makes defamation claims harder to pursue.

## 9. Where is LogiScore legally based?
