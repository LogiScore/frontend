## 1. Introduction

Welcome to LogiScore (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù ‚Äúus‚Äù). LogiScore is a platform where shippers, importers, and exporters (‚ÄúUsers‚Äù or ‚ÄúShippers‚Äù) can share structured ratings of freight forwarders.

By using LogiScore, you agree to these Terms of Service (‚ÄúTOS‚Äù), our **Review Guidelines**, our **Privacy Policy**, and our **Notice & Takedown Policy (NTP)**, which are incorporated by reference.

If you do not agree, you must not use our platform.

## 2. Platform Role & Limitations

* LogiScore is a **neutral host** of user-generated content.
* We do **not endorse** or guarantee the quality of any freight forwarder or service reviewed.
* Ratings represent **personal opinions and experiences** only, not verified facts.
* We do not conduct independent audits of forwarder services.

## 3. User Responsibilities

When using LogiScore, you agree to:

* Submit ratings only if based on **genuine service experiences** within the past 6 months.

Reviewer Anonymity & Disclosure

Reviewer Anonymity
LogiScore allows shippers to submit reviews anonymously. Forwarders and other third parties will not see the reviewer‚Äôs identity. LogiScore verifies that all reviews come from genuine shippers, but the identity of individual reviewers remains strictly confidential.

Disclosure of Identities
LogiScore will never voluntarily disclose a reviewer‚Äôs identity to a forwarder or third party. Reviewer information may only be disclosed if LogiScore is legally required to do so under a valid court order or applicable law from a court of competent jurisdiction.

Limitation of Liability
By submitting a review, you acknowledge that while LogiScore takes all reasonable steps to preserve anonymity, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed if compelled by law.

## 4. Verification of Ratings

* Users may be required to provide proof of shipment (e.g., AWB, Bill of Lading).
* Verification may apply **once per forwarder per subscription period**.
* Identifying details are anonymized; documents are not shared with forwarders.
* Verified users receive a ‚ÄúVerified Shipper‚Äù badge.

## 5. Anonymity & Privacy

* Users may post ratings anonymously.
* Reviewer identities will not be disclosed unless required by law.
* Data is handled according to our **Privacy Policy**.

## 6. Notice & Takedown (NTP)

* Forwarders or third parties may submit removal requests through our **Notice & Takedown Policy**, available here:

## 7. Moderation & Removal

We reserve the right to remove or redact content that:
