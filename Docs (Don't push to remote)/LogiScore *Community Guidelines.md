Great — here’s a **fully redrafted version of the LogiScore Community Guidelines** updated to reflect your model:

---

# 📘 LogiScore Community Guidelines

**Effective Date:** August 2025
**Last Updated:** August 2025

---

## 1. Purpose

LogiScore is a **shipper-only platform** where importers, exporters, and BCOs can share **structured ratings** of freight forwarders. Our goal is to build a transparent, trusted community where shippers can make informed decisions based on genuine experiences.

---

## 2. What Reviews Consist Of

* Ratings are given on a **1–5 scale** across fixed categories such as:

  * Responsiveness
  * Documentation Accuracy
  * Reliability
  * Customer Service
  * Value for Money
  * Proactivity
  * Technology & Visibility
  * After Hours Support

* Reviews are **numerical only**. Free-text comments are not permitted.

* Each rating represents a **shipper’s personal opinion and experience**, not a factual claim about the forwarder.

---

## 3. Verification of Reviews

* To ensure authenticity, shippers may be required to provide **proof of shipment** (e.g., AWB, Bill of Lading, or equivalent).
* Verification is required **once per forwarder per subscription period**.
* Sensitive data (cargo details, consignee names, rates) is stripped and not shared with forwarders.
* Verified shippers receive a **“Verified Shipper” badge**.

---

## 4. Review Frequency & Limits

* Shippers may submit **one review per forwarder branch every six months**.
* Ratings must reflect services actually used within the past **6 months**.
* Multiple reviews from the same company for the same branch in the same six month period may be removed.

---

* Reviewer identities will **never be revealed** to forwarders except when legally required.
* Verified company names may be displayed **only if the shipper chooses**.

---

## 6. Prohibited Behavior

The following are not allowed on LogiScore:

* Submitting ratings without a genuine shipment relationship.
* Submitting ratings on behalf of competitors or employees of a forwarder.
* Creating multiple accounts to manipulate scores.
* Attempting to pressure or threaten other shippers to change their ratings.
* Submitting fraudulent shipment documents for verification.

---

## 7. Dispute Process (Forwarders)

* Forwarders cannot edit or remove ratings directly.
* They may submit a formal complaint under our **[Notice & Takedown Policy](https://logiscore.net/notice-takedown)**.
* Disputes are reviewed by LogiScore’s moderation team within 7 business days.

---

## 8. Enforcement

* **First violation:** Warning + review removal.
* **Second violation:** 30-day suspension of account.
* **Third violation:** Permanent ban from the platform.
* **Severe violations (e.g., fake reviews, fraud, harassment):** Immediate permanent ban.

---

## 9. Transparency & Accountability

* LogiScore publishes a **quarterly Transparency Report** with statistics on takedown requests, removals, and appeals.
* This ensures our moderation process is clear and accountable.

---

## 10. Final Note

These guidelines are designed to protect both shippers and forwarders. By keeping reviews **structured, verified, and opinion-based**, we aim to create a platform that is **fair, credible, and legally resilient**.

---

✅ This version matches your **shipper-only, rating-based model**, bakes in the **one-time verification rule**, and ties in your **Notice & Takedown Policy**.

Would you like me to also create a **shorter, plain-language “Shipper Quick Guide”** (1-page version) that could be shown on the review submission screen — so users see the rules *just before* posting?
