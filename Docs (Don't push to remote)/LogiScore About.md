# About LogiScore

### Driving Transparency in Global Logistics

At **LogiScore**, we believe that trust and accountability are the foundations of great logistics partnerships. Shippers often face challenges when choosing freight forwarders: limited visibility, inconsistent service levels, and a lack of reliable benchmarks. Our mission is to change that.

## What We Do

LogiScore is a **shipper-first community platform** where companies can **rate and review freight forwarders** based on real shipment experiences. Reviews are structured and data-driven, covering key categories such as responsiveness, documentation, shipment handling, technology, and customer experience.

Unlike traditional review platforms, LogiScore is designed to ensure **fairness, authenticity, and compliance**:

* Reviews are submitted only by verified shippers.
* Forwarders cannot edit, remove, or influence reviews.
* Anonymous submissions are allowed, but verified reviews carry full weight for accuracy.
* A structured dispute process ensures balance and fairness.

**Important:** All reviews represent the **opinions and experiences of individual shippers**. LogiScore does not verify the accuracy of each opinion and does not endorse any specific freight forwarder.

## Why It Matters

In an industry where service quality can vary widely, LogiScore provides **objective, comparable insights** into freight forwarder performance.

For shippers, this means greater confidence when selecting a logistics partner. With increased transparency, shippers may be more inclined to switch to a forwarder with stronger performance, creating a market where service quality truly matters.

For forwarders, LogiScore offers more than accountability. It is also an **opportunity to showcase excellence**. High-performing forwarders can use their scores as proof of service quality, strengthening credibility with prospects and giving sales teams a competitive edge in customer negotiations.

We understand that some forwarders may feel uncomfortable with this level of transparency. However, our hope is that LogiScore will serve as a **constructive tool**, helping forwarders identify areas for improvement, raise their level of service, and build stronger, long-term trust with shippers.
