## 1. Purpose

This policy explains how LogiScore handles requests to remove or edit user-generated content (‚ÄúReviews‚Äù or ‚ÄúRatings‚Äù). We aim to balance:

* The right of shippers to share honest experiences.
* The right of freight forwarders to protect their reputation from false or abusive content.
* Our role as a **neutral platform** and not the author of reviews.

## 2. What Content Can Be Reported

A freight forwarder, shipper, or third party may submit a takedown request if a review:

* Violates our **Review Guidelines** (e.g., fake, abusive, defamatory).
* Is **not based on a genuine shipping transaction**.
* Contains **confidential or personal information** (names of individuals, contract details, rates).
* Is **manipulative or fraudulent** (e.g., competitor sabotage, multiple accounts).
* Is otherwise **unlawful under applicable laws**.
