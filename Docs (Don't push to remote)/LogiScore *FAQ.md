# Shipper FAQ

**Q: Who can leave a review?**
A: Only verified shippers with a valid shipment document (e.g., AWB, Bill of Lading) may submit a review. Verification is required once per forwarder during a subscription period.

**Q: Can I leave a review anonymously?**
A: Yes. You may choose to remain anonymous to forwarders and the public. However, anonymous reviews may carry less weight than named, verified reviews.

**Q: What if I use multiple forwarders?**
A: You may review each forwarder you’ve worked with, provided you verify your shipment activity with them.

**Q: Are reviews opinions or verified facts?**
A: All reviews represent the **opinions and experiences of individual shippers**. LogiScore does not verify the accuracy of each opinion and does not endorse any forwarder.

**Q: What categories are used for scoring?**
A: Ratings cover key service categories:

* Responsiveness
* Shipment Management
* Documentation Accuracy
* Customer Experience
* Technology & Visibility Tools
* Reliability & Proactivity
