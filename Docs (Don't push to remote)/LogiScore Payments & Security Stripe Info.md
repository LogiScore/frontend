### 🔐 Payments & Security

All payments on LogiScore are processed securely through **Stripe**, a global leader in online payments. LogiScore does not store your credit card details — Stripe handles this with the highest industry standards (PCI DSS Level 1 compliance). We only keep basic billing information (like your subscription plan and invoice records) for accounting purposes.

Your payment details are **encrypted, protected, and never shared** with forwarders or third parties outside the payment process.
