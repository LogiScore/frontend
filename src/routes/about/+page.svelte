          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>At <strong>LogiScore</strong>, we believe that trust and accountability are the foundations of great logistics partnerships. Shippers often face challenges when choosing freight forwarders: limited visibility, inconsistent service levels, and a lack of reliable benchmarks. Our mission is to change that.</p>
          <p>LogiScore is a <strong>shipper-first community platform</strong> where companies can <strong>rate and review freight forwarders</strong> based on real shipment experiences. Reviews are structured and data-driven, covering key categories such as responsiveness, documentation, shipment handling, technology, and customer experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>Unlike traditional review platforms, LogiScore is designed to ensure <strong>fairness, authenticity, and compliance</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reviews are submitted only by verified shippers</li>
            <li>Forwarders cannot edit, remove, or influence reviews</li>
            <li>Anonymous submissions are allowed, but verified reviews carry full weight for accuracy</li>
            <li>A structured dispute process ensures balance and fairness</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="important-notice">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> All reviews represent the <strong>opinions and experiences of individual shippers</strong>. LogiScore does not verify the accuracy of each opinion and does not endorse any specific freight forwarder.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>In an industry where service quality can vary widely, LogiScore provides <strong>objective, comparable insights</strong> into freight forwarder performance.</p>
          
          <p>For shippers, this means greater confidence when selecting a logistics partner. With increased transparency, shippers may be more inclined to switch to a forwarder with stronger performance, creating a market where service quality truly matters.</p>
          
          <p>For forwarders, LogiScore offers more than accountability. It is also an <strong>opportunity to showcase excellence</strong>. High-performing forwarders can use their scores as proof of service quality, strengthening credibility with prospects and giving sales teams a competitive edge in customer negotiations.</p>
          
          <p>We understand that some forwarders may feel uncomfortable with this level of transparency. However, our hope is that LogiScore will serve as a <strong>constructive tool</strong>, helping forwarders identify areas for improvement, raise their level of service, and build stronger, long-term trust with shippers.</p>
          
          <p>Our goal is to <strong>elevate the logistics industry</strong> by making service performance as transparent as rates and transit times.</p>
