      id: 2,
      question: "How do I find a freight forwarder?",
      answer: "You can search for freight forwarders by company name, location, or services offered. Our platform provides detailed information about each company including their services, locations, and customer reviews."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "Are the reviews verified?",
      answer: "We're working on implementing a verification system to ensure all reviews come from real customers. Currently, we're building the infrastructure to support verified reviews."

  const shipperFaqs = [
    {
      question: "Who can leave a review?",
      answer: "Only verified shippers with a valid shipment document (e.g., AWB, Bill of Lading) may submit a review. Verification is required once per forwarder during a subscription period."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I leave a review anonymously?",
      answer: "Yes. You may choose to remain anonymous to forwarders and the public. However, anonymous reviews may carry less weight than named, verified reviews."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I use multiple forwarders?",
      answer: "You may review each forwarder you've worked with, provided you verify your shipment activity with them."
    },
    {
      question: "Are reviews opinions or verified facts?",
      answer: "All reviews represent the opinions and experiences of individual shippers. LogiScore does not verify the accuracy of each opinion and does not endorse any forwarder."
    },
    {
      question: "What categories are used for scoring?",
      answer: "Ratings cover key service categories: Responsiveness, Shipment Management, Documentation Accuracy, Customer Experience, Technology & Visibility Tools, and Reliability & Proactivity."

    {
      question: "Can forwarders submit reviews?",
      answer: "No. To ensure independence, only shippers may submit reviews."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I disagree with a review?",
      answer: "Forwarders can submit a dispute via the Contact Page. LogiScore operates a structured Notice & Takedown process to review concerns and may remove content that violates our policies or the law."
    },
    {
      question: "Can forwarders edit or remove reviews?",
      answer: "No. Forwarders cannot edit or delete reviews. This guarantees platform independence and fairness."
    },
    {
      question: "How does LogiScore benefit forwarders?",
      answer: "LogiScore isn't only about accountability. High-performing forwarders can use their scores to showcase service quality to prospective customers, supporting sales teams with independent, third-party validation."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I know which shipper left a review?",
      answer: "No. Identities remain confidential, unless disclosure is required under applicable law."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we request LogiScore to amend the company description?",
      answer: "The descriptions are taken from searches in the internet. We understand that they may not meet your marketing guidelines. We are unable to amend the descriptions for you. We suggest subscribing to the \"Subscription Annual Plus\" package where you can take control of the company description."

    },
    {
      question: "How do I write helpful reviews?",
      answer: "Focus on specific experiences, provide concrete examples, and rate each category honestly. Include details about what went well and areas for improvement. Remember, your review helps other shippers make informed decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the rating system work?",
      answer: "Our rating system uses 7 key categories: Responsiveness, Shipment Management, Documentation Accuracy, Customer Experience, Technology & Visibility Tools, Reliability & Proactivity, and Overall Satisfaction. Each category is rated on a 1-5 scale."
    }
  ];

  const searchReviewsFaqs = [
    {
      question: "What are advanced search techniques?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do I use filters effectively?",
      answer: "Start with broad filters and narrow down gradually. Use rating filters to focus on companies with proven track records, location filters for proximity, and service filters for specific needs. Combine multiple filters for precise results."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the review guidelines?",
      answer: "Reviews must be based on real experiences, avoid personal attacks, and provide constructive feedback. Include specific details, rate all categories honestly, and respect confidentiality. Reviews that violate guidelines may be removed."
    },
    {
      question: "How are ratings calculated?",
      answer: "Ratings are calculated from verified user reviews, with each category weighted equally. We use a weighted average system that considers review recency and verification status. Category scores are averaged to create overall company ratings."
    }

    {
      question: "What subscription plans are available?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do billing cycles work?",
      answer: "Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually. Monthly plans renew automatically on the same date each month. Annual plans offer discounted rates and renew yearly. You can change your billing cycle at any time from your account settings."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
